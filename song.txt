The crumbling skyline
Cuts a vicious horizon
Sinking its teeth into the cold September sky
Decaying towers of steel
Reach with crooked spires for the heavens
Like bones of the hollow chest of this town
Torn wide for the scavengers
Mother mercy, take my hand
Follow me through this forsaken land
Father time, return what's mine
The innocence you stole from these eyes
'Cause I just feel, I just feel numb
